    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      This add-in is specifically crafted to excel as a "fluff" generator, serving as a valuable tool for writers
      seeking to enrich their scenes and bring them to life. Whether you're looking to add depth to a setting, embellish
      the details of a character's appearance, or create vivid sensory experiences, this add-in is adept at providing
      creative descriptions that captivate readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, it proves invaluable in those moments when you find yourself grappling for the perfect word. Perhaps
      you're trying to recall a term that's just on the tip of your tongue, or you sense there's a more precise and
      evocative word to express a concept, but it eludes you. This add-in can help bridge that gap, offering a wide
      range of alternatives and synonyms to enhance your writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, while it excels in adding color and detail to your writing, it is not designed to continue your plot or
      develop complex narrative arcs. Its strength lies in enhancing individual paragraphs rather than driving the
      overall story forward.
